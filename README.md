# Time Series Forecasting

## Description

This repository contains implementations of various time series forecasting models aimed at predicting future values in a data sequence over time. These models are applicable to domains such as finance, weather forecasting, and demand planning in supply chain management. My goal is to provide a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly solution for time series analysis for every one interested.

## Features

- **Multiple Forecasting Models**: Implementation of ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, RNN, and more.
- **Data Preprocessing Tools**: Utilities for cleaning and preparing time series data.
- **Evaluation Framework**: Scripts for model evaluation with metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.
- **Visualization Tools**: Functions for plotting data, forecasts, and evaluation metrics.
- **Example Datasets**: Includes sample datasets for demonstration purposes.
